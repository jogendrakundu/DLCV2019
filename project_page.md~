      </p>
      <p>Students are encouraged to select a topic and work on their own projects. However, it is highly recommended that students talk to members of various labs at IISc who are experienced in the topic they have selected.
      </p>
     <p> Projects can be broadly classified of two kinds:
     <ol>
	<li> Application: when Deep learning is used for image processing in other research fields. For example, medical tool segmentation in operation videos.
        </li><li> Improving Deep learning architectures: when interesting new ideas are introduced to pre-existing models for improving their performance. For example, exploring benefits of higher dimensional convolution in a traditional classification setup.
      </li></ol>
      </p>
      <p> <h4> As the course is on using Deep Learning for Computer Vision, the project must visual data in form of pixels etc.</p>
